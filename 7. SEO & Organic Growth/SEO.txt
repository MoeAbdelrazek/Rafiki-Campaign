Rafiki Pet Hospital
Keyword Research & Intent Mapping
Our SEO strategy began with comprehensive keyword research covering over 500 terms segmented by pet type: dogs, cats, grooming, vaccination, and general pet care. Using Ahrefs, SEMrush, and Google Keyword Planner, we collected search volume, CPC, keyword difficulty, and competitor overlap for each keyword.

Keywords were classified by search intent: informational, transactional, navigational, and local searches. We mapped each keyword to specific Meta posts, landing pages, and blog content for strategic alignment. Seasonal patterns were incorporated, ensuring content aligns with vaccination (Jan–Mar) and grooming (May–Aug) peaks.

Competitor gap analysis identified opportunities missed by 9 nearby vet clinics. Keywords relevant to expat residents were added, considering bilingual searches. This ensures a precise match to audience search behavior while maximizing organic visibility.

Category	Top Keywords	Search Volume	CPC (EGP)	Difficulty
Dogs	dog vaccination, puppy care, dog grooming	1200–3000	7–12	Medium
Cats	cat checkup, feline health, cat grooming	900–2500	6–10	Medium
Grooming	pet grooming New Cairo, dog haircut	700–1800	8–14	Low
Vaccination	pet vaccines, rabies vaccine dog	800–2000	9–15	Medium
General Pet Care	pet nutrition, pet clinic, vet near me	1000–2800	5–10	Medium
On-page SEO
All landing pages and Meta posts were optimized with carefully structured H1-H3 headings, keyword-rich meta titles, and descriptions. Alt-texts were added to every image, with internal linking connecting related pages. FAQ content and schema markup improved snippet appearance in SERPs.
